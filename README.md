Hypothesis Class of Finite Union of Disjoint Intervals and ERM Algorithm
In this project, I studied the hypothesis class of a finite union of disjoint intervals, focusing on the properties of the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) algorithm for this class.

Repository Overview
This repository contains two main files:

1. intervals.py:
This file implements the ERM algorithm for the hypothesis class 
𝐻
𝑘
H 
k
​
 . Given a sorted list xs = [x1, x2, ..., xn] and the respective labeling ys = [y1, y2, ..., yn], the function find_best_interval returns a list of up to k intervals and their error counts on the given sample. These intervals minimize the empirical error count from all possible choices of k intervals or fewer.

2. experiment.py:
This file contains multiple experiments conducted to analyze the performance of the ERM algorithm. Specifically:

Experiment 1:

A function calculates the true error 
𝑒
𝑃
(
ℎ
𝐼
)
e 
P
​
 (h 
I
​
 ) for a given list of intervals 
𝐼
I.

T=100 runs:
Draw a sample of size

n and run the ERM algorithm.
Calculate the empirical error for the returned hypothesis.
Calculate the true error for the returned hypothesis.
The results of empirical and true errors are plotted, averaged across 
𝑇
T runs, as a function of 
𝑛
n.
Experiment 2:

A sample of size 
𝑛

n=1500 is drawn.
ERM hypotheses are found for

Experiment 3:

A data set of size

n=1500 is drawn.
The previous experiment is repeated, but two additional lines are plotted as a function of 
𝑘
k:
The penalty.
The sum of the penalty and empirical error.
Experiment 4:

A data set of size 
𝑛
=

n=1500 is drawn and split into training (80%) and holdout-validation (20%).
Requirements
To run the experiments and code, you need Python 3 with the following dependencies:

numpy
matplotlib
You can install the necessary dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy matplotlib
How to Run the Code
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
Run the experiments: To execute the experiments and generate the plots, simply run:

bash
Copy code
python experiment.py
The results will be displayed in the form of plots comparing empirical errors, true errors, and penalties.
